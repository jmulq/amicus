## Problem Statement

In the Web2 landscape, social connections remain fragmented and confined within individual applications. Users face the tedious chore of adding friends repeatedly on multiple platforms, all while surrendering control and ownership of these connections to the applications themselves. The Amicus Protocol steps in to rectify this situation by granting users full ownership and control of their social connections and data within the decentralised internet we envision.

## Key Benefits

### User-Centric Approach

Amicus Protocol will reduce the friction of managing connections across various dApps, aligning with the broader goal of Web3 to empower users and give them more control over their digital experiences.

### User Empowerment

Amicus Protocol empowers users to own and control their social connections and related data, aligning with the Web3 principle of user sovereignty.

### Consistency

Users can enjoy a consistent social experience across various dApps, enhancing usability and reducing the learning curve as they move from one application to another.

### Easing Development for dApps

By offering a standardised solution for social connections, Amicus Protocol can simplify the development process for a multitude of dApps. Rather than each dApp building its own custom friend/connection functionality, they can integrate with the protocol, streamlining development efforts and promoting consistency in user experiences.

## MVP Features

The MVP developed during this hackathon embodies a range of essential features:

User registration with the protocol, allowing users to establish an Amicus Profile by deploying their own profile contract.
Streamlined friend management.
Native and cross-chain friend request capabilities.
Demonstrating Dapp protocol integration, showcasing the effortless mobility of a user's friends across a multitude of Dapps that integrate with the protocol.
